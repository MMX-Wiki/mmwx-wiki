## *REVIEW AGING REPORTS IN BOTH QUICKBOOKS & BILL.COM AT SIMULTANEOUSLY

## QB'S -> REPORTS -> VENDOR -> A/P AGING SUMMARY

BDC -> REPORTS -> VENDOR AGING DETAILS -> SORT BY VENDOR (FOR BREAKDOWN OF INVOICES/CREDITS)

## *REPORTS SHOULD LOOK VERY SIMILAR IN LAYOUT

- OPEN A SEPARATE BDC BROSWER TO VIEW VENDOR ACCOUNTS WITHOUT LEAVING THE A/P AGING REPORT

## REVIEW INVOICE AS NEEDED IN THE VENDOR PORTAL (BDC) OR VENDOR CENTER (QB'S)

REVIEW REPORTS TO LOCATE IF THERE ARE ANY DISCREPENCIES BETWEEN QB'S & BDC. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REASONS THIS NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED:

AN INVOICE THAT HAS BEEN DENIED AND DELETED DID NOT TRANSFER THE DELETION INTO QB'S

## AN CHECK THAT WAS VOIDED FROM BDC BUT THE VOID DID NOT TRANSFER TO QB'S

REVIEW REPORT FOR UNAPPLIED CREDITS: CREDITS ARE NOT EASILY SEEN TO APPROVE OR BE APPLIED IN BDC. REVIEW THE AGING REPORT TO DETERMINE IF THE CREDIT STILL NEEDS TO BE APPROVED AND APPLIED

## REVIEW 90-60-30 DAY COLUMNS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE FOR NON PAYMENT

REMEMBER: QB'S WILL SHOW ALL INVOICES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO BDC WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN APPROVED: QB'S WILL NOT SHOW THE STATUS OF AN INVOICE, WHO IT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO, OR IF BDC SHOWS THAT IT HAS BEEN DENIED BUT NOT DELETED. THUS, THE NEED TO HAVE BDC VENDOR PORTAL OPEN IN A SEPARATE BROSWER TO SEE RECEIVED DATE, APPROVED DATE, SCHEDULED DATE, PM ASSIGNED, DENIAL, NOTES, AND IF IT HAS BEEN DELETED AFTER DENIAL

## REVIEW THIS PROCESS IN BOTH BDC & QB'S TO MAKE SURE REPORTS MATCH

REVIEW INVOICE IN THE VENDOR PORTAL: SEE NOTES SECTION FOR EACH INVOICE UNDER REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE REASONS FOR NON-PAYMENT, MAKE NOTES TO APPROVER AS NEEDED FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEW, DENY INVOICE AS NEEDED: REMEMBER TO MAKE NOTES AS TO WHY YOU ARE DENYING/DELETING THE INVOICE ON BEHALF OF THE APPROVER
