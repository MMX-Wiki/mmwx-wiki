# Credits - bill.cm

There are two ways to add credits in bill.com. The easiest and minimal amount of steps in to process it through bill.com inbox.

The instructions below give you the steps to process it through bill.com inbox

In this example below, you will see two things: Credit Memo & possible duplicate: make sure this is not a duplicate credit before processing: -> Vendor profile -> Credit tab -> Research. Sometimes we are told by the vendor that they applied a credit to one of our invoices before we receive the actual hard copy of the credit. You can identify this when there is a credit entered but not a hard copy of the credit memo. If the credit is already in bill.com but doesn't have a hard copy of the credit memo, you will add the hardcopy of the credit memo as a document to the empty pre-entered credit in bill.com. (instructions to follow on how to enter)

1. It states (a) credit memo instead of invoice. You will not always receive a credit memo. Sometimes it comes over in the form of a(b) paid invoice (this is not always indictive of credit - always ask before processing these types of documents) (c) it is stated in the body of an email or (d) issued on a statement. No matter how it comes over two things must take place. (a) you must hunt down the original invoice and point it to the account that the original invoice came from (b) if it relates to purchasing, you must assign Ken as the approver so that he is aware that there is a credit. He will need to point it back to and credit the correct vendor and GL account in Innergy. This will be especially important if it is job related since we are tracking job costing. A credit owed, if large enough, could make or break a job.

To enter the credit, please note the upper right corner with a dropdown labeled "MORE"

## Make sure to enter

## Vendor Name

Ref #: if you are receiving an actual credit memo you will use the credit memo # (in place of an invoice #). If you receive a credit without the actual credit memo, there are a couple of options. Use the original invoice # adding a .C for credit. If you do not know that information use todays date.

Credit date: this will be the credit memo date if you have one or if receiving it in an email, use the date of the email.

Credit description: make sure to put the reason you received the credit here and if it is job related or shop etc. Please use the standard SOP labeling when entering the credits.

Account: you will locate the original invoice to determine if it was shop, COGS etc to point it back to that account

Approver: Most of the time it will be Ken.

## THIS NEXT PART IS VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT TO BE SKIPPED

- ** You must go back to the vendor profile and apply the credit to an invoice***

Why? Because there is nothing in bill.com to alert you that there is a credit hanging out there to be applied.

If the original invoice has already been paid and therefore you cannot apply it to that invoice, you will select the next oldest invoice to apply it to.

Once in the vendor profile and you have identified the correct invoice to appy the credit to, you will click on the credits link as highlighted here:
