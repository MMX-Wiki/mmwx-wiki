POSTIVE PAY: APPROVAL PENDING POSITIVE PAY TRANSACTIONS ON GUARANTY BANK: BUSINESS BANKING: POSITIVE PAY: REVIEW EXCEPTIONS FOR ALL ACCOUNTS: APPROVE OR DENY EACH TRANSACTION: SUBMIT BY 9:30AM EVERY MORNING EXCEPT ON WEEKENDS OR MOST FEDERAL HOLIDAYS ***SCROLL DOWN TO BANK FEEDS TO SEE RESEARCH OPTIONS***

## LOG INTO GUARANTY BANK ->

## #2: SYNC BILL.COM TO QUICKBOOKS

2. SYNC BILL.COM TO QB'S (in Citrix portal - activate app & sync) QB'S MUST BE FULLY OPENED FIRST, THEN OPEN BILL.COM SYNC. SELECT SYNC. ONCE SYNC ERRORS HAVE BEEN CLEARED, REVIEW IN BILL.COM UNDER STATUS:

ONCE THE SYNC HAS COMPLETED, CLOSE THE DIALOGUE BOX - THE SYNCING PROCESS HAS BEEN COMPLETED NORMALLY, THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY SYNC ERRORS BUT BECAUSE OF INITIAL SYNC WITH BILL.COM, THIS WILL NEED TO BE CLEANED UP. (INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CLEAN UP THE SYNC ERRORS IN BILL.COM ARE NEEDED)

## #3: BANK FEEDS

3. BANK FEEDS: PULL IN BANK FEEDS FOR BOTH OPERATING & PAYROLL ACCOUNTS: IN QUICKBOOKS, GO TO BANK FEEDS (LEFT SIDE BAR, BLUE AREA) SELECT BANK FEEDS -> SELECT OK TO EXCLUSIVE USE SELECT ARROWS IN TOP RIGHT CORNER. IT WILL ASK FOR BANKING PIN. THIS IS YOUR PASSWORD TO CONNECT TO ONLINE BANKING (GUARANTY BANK) ONCE YOU PUT IN THE BANKING PIN, YOU CAN REVIEW THE TRANSACTIONS BY SELECTING DOWNLOAD TRANSACTIONS. RELEASE EXCLUSIVE USE UNDER BANKING>BANKFEEDS>RELEASE EXCLUSIVE USE
**RULE #1:** NEVER ENTER CUSTOMER DEPOSITS FROM THIS SCREEN: YOU MUST ENTER CUSTOMER DEPOSITS FROM THE CUSTOMER CENTER: WHEN YOU SEE AN ACH PENDING, LET THE AR SPECIALIST KNOW SO THEY CAN PREPARE THE REMITTANCE AND ENTER INTO INNERGY. YOU SHOULD RECEIVE THE REMITTANCE WHEN IT HAS BEEN PROCESSED IN INNERGY: SEE DAILY DEPOSITS IN STEP #7 FOR MORE INFORMATION:

**RULE #2:** BEFORE ENTERING AN UNMATCHED TRANSACTION, MAKE SURE TO SEARCH QB'S IN THE VENDOR PROFILE OR CONTROL-F TO MAKE SURE THAT TRANSACTION HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN ADDED AND THERE IS NOT SOME SORT OF DISCREPRENCY CAUSING IT NOT TO MATCH. IT COULD ALSO BE AN INDICATOR THAT THIS IS A DUPLICATE CHARGE COMING OVER FROM THE BANK OR FRAUD. PLEASE SEE MORE STEPS FOR HOW TO RESEARCH TRANSACTIONS BELOW UNDER "NORMAL PLACES TO GATHER INFORMATION TO VERIFY TRANSACTIONS"

**RULE #3:** NEVER ENTER BILL.COM JE FROM THIS SCREEN. ENTERING BILL.COM JE DIRECTLY INTO QB'S WILL BE EXTREMELY RARE: CONTACT BILL.COM FOR SUPPORT IF IT IS NOT SYNCING CORRECTLY

**RULE #4:** DO NOT SET RULES IN BANK FEEDS UNLESS YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE AND EFFECT AND YOU ARE FULLY KNOWLEDGIBLE ON HOW THEY WORK.

**RULE #5:** USE THE IGNORE TRANSACTION BUTTON RARELY. OCCASIONALLY, YOU WILL GET A CHECK OVER FROM THE BANK FEEDS AND THE BANK HAS MIS-KEYED THE CHECK # OR THE AMOUNT. VERIFY THAT WHAT IS IN QB'S MATCHING WHAT CLEARED. IF WE WROTE THE CHECK OR IT CAME OVER FROM BILL.COM AND THE BANK SENT IT OVER INCORRECTLY, WE LEAVE THE ORIGINAL, ENTER THE CORRECT INFORMATION ON THE TRANSACTIONS IN QB'S AND MAKE A NOTE IN THE MEMO FIELD AS TO WHY THERE IS AN DISCREPENCY OR ERROR. IN THIS CASE, YOU WILL IGNORE THE TRANSACTION IN THE BANK FEEDS. IT WILL NOT HAVE THE LIGHTNING BOLT AS CONFIRMATION IN THE QB CHECK REGISTER. UNFORTUNETLY, THIS WILL HAVE TO BE THE CASE FOR AUDITING PURPOSES.

**RULE #6:** DO NOT ADD ACH DEPOSITS UNTIL THEY ARE PENDING. METRO IS THE WORST AT SENDING OVER ACH NOTIFICATION AND THEN NOT SCHEDULING THE PAYMENT.

**RULE #7:** DO NOT ADD PROJECT RELATED, OPERATIONS EXPENESES, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF PO RELATED EXPENSES FROM THIS SCREEN. THERE ARE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO HANDLE THESE TRANSACTIONS LISTED IN THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SOP. THE OPERATIONS ADMIN IS MOSTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENTERING THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THROUGH CREDIT CARD BATCH TRANSACTIONS OR BILL.COM. IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE WITH UNMATCHED TRANSACTIONS IN THESE AREAS PLEASE SEEK OUT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE OPERATIONS ADMIN.

**RULE #8:** TRANSFERS TO/FROM ACCOUNT #3285 IS TREVOR'S PERSONAL ACCOUNT. EVERYTHING WILL BE POINTED TOWARDS HIS DRAW ACCOUNT (30000 KNIGHT DRAW - CURRENT YEAR). HE WILL LATER RECLASS IT IF IT IS A BUSINESS EXPENSE.


BLUE: MEANS THE TRANSACTION HAS ALREADY BEEN ENTERED INTO QB'S. EITHER BY JE ENTRIES FROM BILL.COM SYNC, IIF DOWNLOADS FROM THE PAYROLL SERVICE, MANUALLY PRINTING CHECKS OR MANUALLY ENTERING ACH'S. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO REVIEW EACH TRANSACTION CODED IN BLUE TO LOOK FOR ANY CODING ERRORS OR OTHER ABNORMALITIES. ORANGE: MEANS THE TRANSACTION WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO QB'S BUT A RULE WAS ASSIGNED TO IT. YOU MUST REVIEW THESE WITH A KEEN EYE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE TRULY MATCHED CORRECTLY AND POINTED TO THE ASSIGNED ACCOUNT. AS YOU GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE FLOW AND GL ACCOUNTS, THIS WILL MAKE MORE SENSE. PLEASE DO NOT SET ANY NEW RULES UNTIL YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW RULES FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSE AND EFFECT. YELLOW: MEANS THAT IT WAS NOT ENTERED INTO QB'S VIA NORMAL MEANS AHEAD OF TIME AND MUST BE RESEARCHED TO VERIFY IT IS A LEGIT TRANSACTION: NORMAL PLACES TO GATHER INFORMATION TO VERIFY TRANSACTIONS OR DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE ENTERING A TRANSACTION: - PAYROLL REPORTS: LOCATED IN THE CONTROLLER FOLDER: PAYROLL: YEAR: PAYROLL WEEK: PDF PAYROLL REPORTS - QB'S: SEVERAL WAYS TO SEARCH HERE: CHECK BANK REGISTERS FOR PRE-ENTERED INTO QB'S: CONTROL-F TO SEARCH BY TOTAL, NAME, ETC. LOOK IN QB'S TO SEE IF THERE ARE PRIOR TRANSACTION IN THE VENDOR PROFILE (BLUE BAR TO THE LEFT) - BILL.COM: OCCANSIONALLY YOU WILL NEED TO RESEARCH BILL.COM. - IN QB'S, YOU CAN CONTROL-F TO FIND A PRIOR TRANSACTION. MAKE SURE THAT YOU CHANGE THE OPTIONS TO ADVANCE SETTINGS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEARCH FOR A SPECIFIC TOTAL AS SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE TO THE RIGHT. - IF IT IS JOB COSTED RELATED, OPERATIONAL EXPENSE, OR PO EXPENSE, PLEASE SEE OPERATIONS ADMIN TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTIONS. THEN THEY SHOULD BE CHECKED MARKED BLUE AND CAN BE ADDED/APPROVED. - OCCASSIONALLY, A TRANSACTION WILL COME THROUGH AND YOU KNOW FOR SURE IT WAS ENTERED INTO QB'S, CONTROL-F TO SEE IF TRANSACTIONS IS ALREADY IN QB'S. IF IT IS IN QB'S AND IT HAS BEEN MATCHED ALREADY IN BANK FEEDS, IT COULD BE AN INDICATOR THAT A DUPLICATE TRANSACTION CAME THROUGH OR IT IS FRAUD.

IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE , SEVERAL DEPOSITS ARE CHECKED MARKED AND HIGHLIGHTED BLUE. THESE TRANSACTIONS CAN BE ADDED/APPROVED BY USING THE DROPDOWN ARROW NEXT TO BATCH ACTIONS. THE YELLOW TRANSACTIONS (DEPOSITS) ARE NOT HIGHLIGHTED AND NEED TO BE ENTERED THROUGH CUSTOMER CENTER AND ADDED TO THE SPECIFIC PROJECT AS CODED ON THE DEPOSIT REMITTANCE GIVEN BY THE AR SPECIALIST: FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW TO ENTER DEPOSITS, SEE STEP# 7.

IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE , YOU WILL SEE THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MATCHING STATUS. - BLUE: MEANS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO QB'S AND MATCHES. AFTER A SNIFF TEST, YOU CAN ADD/APPROVE THESE TRANSACTIONS. - ORANGE: MEANS IT HAS A RULE SET, NEEDS REVIEW TO MAKE SURE IT IS POINTED TO THE CORRECT GL ACCOUNT AND IS CODED CORRECTLY. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF REVIEW WOULD BE KROGER INSIDE THE STORE PURCHASE VS FUEL PURCHASE. A LATE CHARGE FROM THE BANK VS INTEREST FROM A LOAN OR RENEWAL FEES. AFTER REVIEW, YOU CAN ADD THESE TRANSACTIONS. - YELLOW: MEANS THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ENTERED NOR DOES IT HAVE A RULE SET. PLEASE SEE OPERATIONS ADMIN ANY MISSING TRANSACTIONS WHEN RELATED TO PROJECT RELATED EXPENSES, OPERATIONS EXPENSES, OR PO RELATED EXPENSES. THIS PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CODING THESE TRANSACTIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON HOW TO CODE THESE TRANSACTIONS, SEE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SOP IN THE SOP FOLDER. ONCE YOU HAVE REVIEWED ALL TRANSACTIONS, ENTERED ANY MISSING DEPOSITS OR EXPENSES, IT IS NOW TIME TO APPROVE THE TRANSACTIONS. APPROVE TRANSACTIONS: -> IN QB'S, IN THE DOWNLOAD TRANSACTIONS SCREEN, MAKE SURE THAT ONLY THE APPROVED TRANSACTIONS ARE CHECKED MARKED. -> GO TO THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER MARKED BATCH TRANSACTIONS -> SELECT DOWN ARROW -> SELECT ADD/APPROVE TRANSACTIONS OR IF APPROPIATE, IGNORE TRANSACTIONS

DO NOT ENTER DEPOSITS IN QB'S OR INNERGY UNTIL TRAINING ON THIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND YOU ARE GIVEN THE GO-AHEAD TO DO SO!!! INSTRUCTIONS ARE INCOMPLETE - DO NOT USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPLETE DEPOSITS - DO NOT COMPLETE DEPOSITS IN QB's:

## 7. CUSTOMER DEPOSITS

QUICK CHECKLIST OF PROCESS: (IN-DEPTH DETAILS TO FOLLOW BELOW): | Molly's checklist to complete receiving the remittances from Sarah.

- STAMP ON BACK OF CHECK: MEMPHIS MASTERWORKS, LLC DEPOSIT ONLY OR FOR GBT MOBILE DEPOSIT ONLY
- TAKE AR NOTES FROM INNERGY (WRITTEN ON EACH CHECK REMITTANCE) TO INPUT DEPOSIT INTO QB'S TO THE CORRECT GC AND PROJECT: A REMITTANCE SHOULD BE RECEIVED FOR CHECKS AND ACH'S
- ONCE ENTERED INTO INNERGY & QB'S, DEPOSIT AT PHYSICAL BANK LOCATION OR MOBILE DEPOSIT
- SCAN TO CONTROLLER FOLDER -> BANKING -> OPERATING - DEPOSITS -> YEAR -> LABEL BY DATE (ONLY DO THIS AFTER THE AR SPECILIAST HAS PUT THE JOB DETAIL ON THE CHECKS OR ACH REMITTANCE)
- IT IS OK TO SCAN MOBILE DEPOSITS TOGETHER AS LONG AS THEY ARE DEPOSITED ON THE SAME DATE
- MAKE SURE TO SCAN DEPOSIT SLIP WITH CHECKS IF DEPOSITING CHECKS AT A PHYSICAL BANK LOCATION
- MAKE SURE TO SCAN ACH NOTICES SEPARATE FROM CHECKS SINCE THE ACH NOTICES COME THROUGH SEPARATLY FROM THE CHECKS
**RULE #1:** VERIFY WITH AR THAT NONE OF THE DETAIL INCLUDES MATERIAL DEPOSITS, STONE DEPOSITS, OR RETAINAGE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON THE DETAIL BUT IS SOMETIMES IS LEFT OFF. THESE THREE ITEMS ARE HANDLED DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR DEPOSITS SO IT IS VERY CRUCIAL TO CONFIRM THIS INFORMATION.

**RULE #2:** DO NOT ENTER ACH PAYMENTS FROM NOTICES UNTIL YOU SEE THE ACH PENDING IN THE BANK ACCOUNT. IF FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH (AND IT HAPPENS) THE BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE WILL BE OVERSTATED

**RULE #3:** IF AN ACH COMES OVER IN THE BANK ACCOUNT, YOU MUST NOTIFY AR SPECIALIST IN TEAMS CHAT, INBOUND CHECK. BEST PRACTICE SHOULD BE TO TAKE A SNIPPET OF THE TRANSACTION SHOWING DATE, CUSTOMER/PROJECT, AND AMOUNT OF DEPOSIT. THE AR SPECIALIST WILL THEN

**RULE #4:** ENTER THE CHECKS INTO QB'S EXACTLY HOW YOU DEPOSITED THEM OR HOW THEY CAME OVER (ACH) *IF YOU MOBILE DEPOSIT THE CHECKS, THEY WILL COME OVER INDIVIDUALLY INTO THE BANK ACCOUNT. THIS IS HOW THEY NEED TO BE ENTERED INTO THE QB'S CHECK REGISTER. SAME WITH ACH'S. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE ACH COMING IN AT A TIME, DO NOT COMBINE THE DEPOSITS IN THE QB'S BANK REGISTER SINCE THEY WILL COME OVER INTO THE BANK ACCOUNT SEPARATELY

**RULE #5:** NEVER USE THE PARENT ACCOUNT (GC NAME) TO ADD PAYMENT OR AN INVOICE: THERE IS A GLITCH IN QB'S THAT WILL NOT SHOW PAYMENTS IN THE SUB ACCOUNT (PROJECT NAME/NUMBER) IF IT IS DIRECTED TO THE PARENT ACCOUNT. ALWAYS PUT DEPOSITS TO THE SUB ACCOUNT

**RULE #6:** DO NOT ENTER DEPOSITS FROM BANK FEEDS SCREEN: MUST ALWAYS GO THROUGH CUSTOMER CENTER:

**RULE #7:** NEVER-EVER ENTER DEPOSITS INTO QB'S UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE REMITTANCE FROM THE AR SPECIALIST: THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW THE SOP FROM THE POINT IT GOES INTO INNERGY FIRST AND THEN COMES TO YOU TO PUT INTO QB'S.


PROCESS STATED HERE IS FROM THE POV THAT THE AR SPECIALIST HAS ENTERED THE PAYMENTS INTO INNERGY, INNERGY DETAILS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE REMITTANCE, AND IS READY TO BE PUT INTO QB'S: THE AR SPECIALIST WILL ENTER THE DEPOSITS INTO INNERGY AND GIVE YOU THE REMITTANCE TO ENTER INTO QB'S: | TO SEE THE PROJECTS IN THE EXPANDED LIST VIEW, RIGHT CLICK NEAR ANY PROJECT -> SELECT HIERARCHIAL VIEW

STEP #1: YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE DEPOSITS FROM THE AR SPECIALIST WITH INNERGY DETAILS -> OPEN QB'S -> STAMP BACK OF THE CHECK WITH MMWX STAMP DETAILS:

STEP #2: GO TO CUSTOMER CENTER -> SELECT THE PROJECT: MOST OF THE TIME IT IS EASIER TO LOCATE THE JOB # INSTEAD OF BY NAME SINCE THERE ARE MANY REPETITIVE PROJECT NAMES:

THE INSTRUCTIONS LISTED BELOW ARE ONLY FOR HOW TREVOR HAS BEEN HANDLING INVOICES IN QB'S - IN THE NEAR FUTURE, INNERGY AND QB'S INVOICE #'S/TOTAL SHOULD MATCH. FOR NOW, THIS IS HOW TO PROCEED:

REFERENCE: YELLOW INDICATES THE PARENT COMPAY GREEN INDICATES SUB COMPANY WITH PROJECT NAME

## 5. LABEL IN SAME FORMAT AS PRIOR RECONCILIATION REPORTS

## 6. EMAIL STATEMENTS TO OWNER

**RULE #1:** IF A TRANSACTION IS MISSING, DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY ADD IT. | TREVOR KNIGHT: HOW TO:

BANK TRANSACTIONS: IF A BANK TRANSACTION IS MISSING, IT IS OK TO RESEARCH IT AND IT IF APPROPIATE, YOU COULD ADD IT BUT DO NOT ADD IT AUTOMATICALLY. THIS SHOULD BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN SINCE BANK FEEDS ARE ENTERED EVERYDAY ALONG WITH THE BILL.COM SYNC. GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY IT IS NOT IN THERE FIRST. THEN MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE SOP TO ADD TRANSACTIONS OR IF SOP DOES NOT ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC SITUATION, SEE IF THERE ARE PRIOR TRANSACTIONS FROM THAT VENDOR AS A GUIDE. REMEMBER TO SELECT ALL VENDORS AS WE DO MAKE VENDORS INACTIVE IF NOT USED REG.

CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: IF A CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION IS MISSING, IT IS NEVER OK TO ADD THE TRANSACTION UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED AND GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT TO DO SO. PLEASE COMMUNICATE THE MISSING TRANSACTION(S) TO THE OPERATIONS ADMIN ATTENTION SO THAT SHE CAN FOLLOW SOP PROTOCOL TO ADD THE TRANSACTIONS EXCEPTIONS: ONLY IS THE CAPITAL ONE CARD: YOU CAN ADD ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS TO TK DRAW - CURRENT YEAR. HE WILL MOVE OUT WHAT IS BUSINESS FROM HIS DRAW.

**RULE #2:** INTEREST OR LATE FEES: DO NOT ADD THE INTEREST OR LATE FEES FROM THE RECONCILIATION SCREEN: TRANSACTIONS ARE ADDED IN REGULARLY SO THOSE CHARGES WILL ALREADY BE ENTERED: IF ADD THEM AT THE RECONCILATION SCREEN, YOU WILL DOUBLE THE EXPENSE AND PROBABLY WILL NOT SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS SINCE IT WILL NOT SHOW IN THE SCREEN THAT LETS YOU CHECK THE EXPENSE. IF THE OPS ADMIN PUT THE TRANSACTION IN ALREADY AND YOU ENTERED IT IN THE BEGINNING RECON SCREEN, YOU WILL ONLY SEE IT CHECKED OFF ONCE BALANCING SCREEN. THE SECOND ENTRY WILL BE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT AT THE BEGINNING RECON SCREEN. IF THIS HAPPENS, REMOVE IT FROM THE BEGINNING RECON SCREEN AND NOT THE ENTRY THAT THE OPERATIONS ADMIN ADDED, AS THIS IS THE CORRECT WAY TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION.

**RULE #3:** TRANSACTIONS MUST MATCH: HOW THE TRANSACTION COMES OVER FROM THE BANK ACCOUNT/CREDIT CARD IS HOW IT NEEDS TO BE ENTERED INTO QB'S. IT IS NOT BEST PRACTICE TO SPLIT ONE TRANSACTION (FROM THE BANK ACCOUNT/CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS) INTO SEVERAL TRANSACTIONS INTO QB'S OR VICE VERSA. THIS IS NOT A DESIRED PRACTICE AS IT MUDDY'S UP THE WATERS FOR A CLEAR AUDIT OR TRACKABILITY.
