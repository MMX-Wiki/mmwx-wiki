# Loose Receipts - Credit Cards -

THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED: IT HAS SINCE CHANGED: Loose receipts typically come from credit card transactions: Cardmember Service (Chase) and Capital One. i.e. fuel, hotel charges, repairs, supplies, etc. For invoices for job related expenses, please refer to invoices paid by credit card. Auto Zone and Home Depot are handled a little differently since we can pull the invoice detail from the online account - this only applies if they charge to the Auto Zone and Home Depot credit card account. If they used the Chase account at one of these stores it will be process under loose receipts: See below on how to handle the invoices/receipts if charged to The Home Depot or Auto Zone accounts.

## Preparation: Receipts

Sort loose receipts by type: then by month: put in date order:

- Cut receipts so the that there is less excess paper, tape to sheets of printer paper. *type, then date order. *The receipts should be taped in order by the type, one month at a time, in date order. (add example ------>>>)

Scan to bill.com, save as a document under the vendor

## Type

Vendor: There is a vendor in bill.com titled "Receipts"

Fuel: all gas receipts

Vehicle: all vehicle related receipts to include: car repairs, car parts, parking, etc. Do not include fuel receipts.

Restaurants: include all receipts for meals

Travel: hotel receipts: if there are fuel or meal receipts - they can go with their respective "type"

Shop/Equipment: repairs, shop supplies, tools, job materials

Office Expense: office supplies, kitchen & bathroom supplies, etc.

Job Related Expense: Make sure a PO is created in Innergy if there is not one in place and there is a description in the QB's memo area. - New process - write out research transactions process: Send Ken information on missing PO so he can create it in Innergy - the transaction will be pointed to research transactions to be able to follow up with Ken

Labeling: When labeling the loose receipts (that have been scanned as described as above) make sure you put label in this order: type: month/date ---->>> see example. This is important so that the same type of transactions are lumped together for easy review purposes: In the example shown here, individual receipts were saved so there is a specific date. When scanning bulk receipts in for the month, it will have the month and year 09-2023 listed instead of 9-25-23.

Home Depot/Auto Zone

Both of these vendors will have *pay online* after their name since we only pay these online. They will not be entered into bill.com as a bill. We are only storing the invoices for record keeping purposes in bill.com. The expense will be put into QB's. If it is job related, it will need to be put into Innergy as well.

- We will not enter the individual transaction in bill.com because it will bring it over as bill instead of a credit card charge. Credit card charges (in this case) should be entered against the credit card so that it can be reconciled every month. If you enter it into bill.com and it comes over as bill, it will be able to go into the credit card account, the expense will be doubled (if you enter it in as credit card transaction) and the credit card account can never be reconciled.

## Weekly

1. Log into their online portal to enter the previous weeks transactions. You can go to the QB's credit card register for each account to see the last date and totals of the last transactions that were entered.
2. In QB's -> Banking (at top center) -> enter credit card transactions-> there will be a button at the top right corner to enter credit card transactions in bulk. If you are entering several at one time this will save a lot of time.
3. With QB's open on one screen and the credit card online account open, enter the transactions into QB's where you left off the week before. If you are entering bulk transactions, make sure to identify any transactions that need to be entered into Innergy for job costing. Do not select save just yet.
4. Review the bulk transactions screen for job related expenses: Open Innergy to enter job related expense to each job. (more details to come)
5. Once you have the job related expense entered in Innegy for each job, you can save the transactions in QB's.
6. In QB's, when saving the bulk transactions to a credit card, make sure that you have the correct credit card selected (at top left) If you do not, it will save it to the incorrect credit card and you will need to then move individual transaction from the incorrect account to the correct account.

## Monthly

Payment: We should be entering the transaction into QB's weekly but we will only pay the statement and pull the invoices for our records once a month. When we pay the monthly statement, we will pull all the invoices for the payment we are making. This is time consuming but necessay. (more details to come)

Invoice copies: (more details to come) (clarify) Auto Zone invoices are straight forward to download from their site. Home depot is more involved. You will download all invoices that make up the payment total, save them to your computer. Once you have them all on your computer, you will start a combine pdf file. You will combine all of the invoices into one pdf, label as shown, and save to Home Depot/Auto Zone as a document, receipts folder in bill.com.

Save to bill.com: you will follow the steps for saving loose receipts with this exception:
