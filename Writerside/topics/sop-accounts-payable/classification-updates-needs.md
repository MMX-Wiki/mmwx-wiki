# Classification - Updates Needs

i.e. | * do not use other expenses or other income

- TK expenses - how to and when to point to draw
- use fixed assetts sparingly: when is a fixed assett?
- differences in dues & subscriptions & software expenses
- define office expenses
- do not guess. Look at the vendor profile to see where it was classified before - check a couple of different transactions to see if there are different ways of classifying transactions for a vendor. i.e. a vendor could supply materials and be a subcontractor. If in doubt, put in research transactions for Donna to review. put not in description (Donna) and send email to review.
- See past emails to Kourtney (and Laurie) with key points
- invoices that do not have invoice #'s - mileage, cell phone etc - special note on Wurth - must include the first letters at the beginning.
- expense report rule - deadline to turn it in (according to handbook and accounting principals)

## Kourtney - 7/1/25 meeting

- Cell phone - recurring - set up in bill.com - show her how it works. Get rid of duplicates
- Mileage dates - invoice dates need to be the range of dates on the expense report with the year added. It needs to be uniform for easy viewing and research - otherwise gets very messy and hard to audit. | vvvvvv
- do not put the date backwards - it messes up the order in the vendor profile
- notice needs to go out that all expense/mileage reports need to be caught up by date ________ after that date, expense reports need to be turned in by the 5th of the next month. i.e. May dates need to be turned in by June 5th
- if 30 days late. Should be automatic denial
- need to review all (current) employee vendor profiles for invoice #/date clean up. Cannot make changes before May in bill.com - I do not sync for prior with bill.com for a reason. It gets ticky.
- just saw when paying bills (review all though) Zach, Nathan Potts, Travis Haygood,
- installers - expense reports - weekly. Everyone else monthly
- monthly expenses are coming over split up instead of all on one report - Tom's report.

Take away. Please ask more questions. Please do not guess. Almost everything has a set pattern in place - before making up your own or changing it i.e. invoices that do not have #'s or having installers submit cell phone allowance on expense reports - see what has been done in the past. If you would like to change it, let's have a discussion first. We need more communication - if I am not immediately available - Sarah has done input AP for a long while. She knows most of the answers. But a note to me in my absence is prefered. Teams, email, or text - lets choose a standard :)
