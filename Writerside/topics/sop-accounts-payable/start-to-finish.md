# Start to Finish

Inbox must be processed by Wednesday morning each week for weekly reporting to CFO:

## Inbox

Sort: Sort the inbox to show oldest to newest.

## Review the entire inbox for debris

Statements or receipts: Look for statements or receipts that can easily saved to documents

Duplicate Invoices: Look for duplicate invoices: Please note two things:

1. Not all invoices are shown as duplicate when entering. Sometimes the AI is faulty. If you enter an invoice, go to save it, and it says that it is a duplicate, duplicate your browser to search in the vendor file to see if the invoice is in their profile by invoice date/number and amount. If you can confirm that it is the same invoice, it is ok to delete the invoice you are working on from the inbox.
2. Sometimes the AI will show invoices as duplicates in the inbox. Most of the time they are duplicates and they can be deleted but first you must do a quick test. Make sure the invoice number circled at the top matches the invoice number highlighted on the invoice. If they are the same number, total, etc. It is ok to delete it from the inbox. If the invoice number is different at the top than shown on the invoice, then it is most likely being flagged because the total is the same as another invoice for this vendor. This happens often as we often order the same supplies in the same quanitites. In this scenario, add the invoice as a bill to be processed?

## AI generated vs memorization

When entering invoices into bill.com, it has both AI and auto memorization that happens. The example below shows the areas the bill.com uses AI to prepopulate invoice details by reading the invoice provided. The second example shows how bill.com uses an auto memorization function to assist in completing the invoice information. This should be used as a guide or prompting to make the necessary changes. See below to know how, when, what to change as needed.

AI generated in bill.com when entering an invoice: Make sure to review what AI generated. Each of the highlighted fields will need to be verified that they match what is on the invoice. Occasionally, AI will glitch and not populate those fields correctly.

Memorization: Bill.com will memorize the information from the last bill that was entered for this vendor. You will need to verify the highlighted fields below and make any necessary changes below.

PO# Validation: In Innergy, go to purchasing -> purchase orders. Enter the purchase order number listed on the invoice. *GL Account #: Looking up the PO in Innergy will provide the GL account needed to complete processing the invoice in bill.com - at least for Ops related expense. For all other expenses, a decent guide would be to look at a couple of prior invoices to see what was used before. *Review Vendor Name: Do a quick review to make sure that the name of the vendor matches the name on the invoice. *Review Dates: Check to see if the date are in range of the date on the invoice. i.e. the PO date was 5 years before our invoice date, we know there is something off. *Review amount: Is it within a few cents off from the invoice or is there a huge discrepancy in the amount? If so, you will @ken in the notes section of the invoice to make him aware. Sometimes, we get more than one invoice for one PO#. Occasionally, a PO gets missed Innergy and calling out special attention to Ken (or the approver) makes sure the PO will be entered into Innergy. *PO assigned approver: it will almost always be Ken for operations related transactions. Please see the Approvers/Approvals tab for more information if needed *Disrepancies: always @ the approver in the notes section if there are any questionable issues. This leaves the notes in bill.com, bill.com sends an email realted to the invoice to the @ person, and leaves a trail for audting purposes. *Follow up: we are not responsible to follow up with the reviewer to make sure that they follow through unless there is a special situation or an urgent matter. *Missing PO#: If you cannot find a PO# in Innergy that is listed on the invoice, most of the time the vendor put the wrong PO#. Search under the Vendor name in Innergy to see if you can find a date or amount close to the invoice details. @ken (or approver) to let them know that the PO# listed on the invoice is not found in Innergy or cannot find the dollar amount under the Vendor. Ken is usually pretty good about fnding them and responding to the note in Innergy.

Non-PO# Invoices: Not all invoices will have PO#'s: Services such as utlities (electric, water, gas), Insurance policies, accountant services, software, IT services, vehicle repair, and more are excluded from having a PO#. Almost all direct cost to projects and operational costs will have a PO#. It will be found on their invoice. There will be a couple of exceptions that we are dealing with now. Byler does not provide PO#'s on their invoices but they need to: Michael, Ken, Clark, and Adam are all aware. Assign Ken as the approver, put Galloway or Flicker for the PO#. In the description, No PO#Galloway or Flicker: Contacted Ken for PO.
