# Approvers-Approvals

PO#: anything that comes over with a PO: job materials, shop materials & supplies, small tools, equipment repairs, inventory, etc. | Ken Lee: Purchaser

Subcontract labor, temp labor, equipment repairs without a PO, & vehicle repairs. If it doesn't have a PO on it but it is job/shop related, assign it to Ken for approval first, and then occasionally Clark. You will @KenLee in the notes to remind him to make sure a PO is created in Innergy. This is especially important if it is job related since this is how the transaction will be applied in Innergy for job costing purposes. | Combination of Ken & Scott as of 6/6/24: need to define after Myers termination

Utilities, office related items, Insurance policies, etc. | Donna Leggett: Controller

Supervisor Expenses, Ogle Clinton, Cbiz, | Trevor Knight: Owner

Unsure: if you are unsure where to assign it, @ Donna Leggett in the notes for direction | GL Account: Research transactions
